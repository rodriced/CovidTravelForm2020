# CovidTravelForm2020

## Introduction
I created this application to play with Elm during the first confinement about the Covid epidemic in France. It creates a derogatory travel certificate. 

It presents a form where you put your personnal informations and your motivation for traveling, and when submited, it generates a clean certificate with a valid QR code.

## How to test it

- Install Elm (https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html)
- Install the node package elm-live (`npm i -g elm-live`)
- Launch the app with the make.sh script : `./make.sh --start`
- Your browser should open at http://localhost:8001
